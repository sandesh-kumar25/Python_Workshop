# Python_Workshop
A Collection of codes, projects, assignments that I have learned in my College during the Workshop session. This Repository includes set of codes, challenges, that I learned during classes.
Python classes are a fundamental building block of object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow developers to create reusable, modular, and organized code by bundling data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single entity. Classes serve as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of the class.
## Key Features of Python Classes
### 1. Encapsulation
### 2.Inheritance
### 3.Attributes and Methods
### 4.Polymorphism
### 5.Abstarction
